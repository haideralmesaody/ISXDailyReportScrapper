# ISX Daily Reports Scrapper - Project Context

## Project Overview
A Go application for scraping daily reports with a web-based licensing system.

## Recent Issues Fixed

### License Activation Navigation Bug ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Navigation from license page to main page was not working correctly
- **Root Cause**: Timing issues between license activation and validation during redirect
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Solution**: 
  - Extended redirect delay from 2 to 3 seconds
  - Added cache busting parameter to prevent cached responses
  - Improved license validation for recently activated licenses (15 min window)
  - Enhanced file modification time checking for better recent activation detection
- **Files modified**: 
  - `web/license.html` - Fixed redirect timing and added cache busting
  - `cmd/web-licensed/main.go` - Improved `validateLicenseForWebAccess()` and `serveIndex()` functions

### License Status Footer Error ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: License status footer showing "Cannot verify license due to network issues" despite valid license
- **Root Cause**: Status API using strict network validation while main page used lenient validation for recently activated licenses
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified license status API to use same smart validation as main page (`validateLicenseForWebAccess()`)
  - Only perform network-based renewal checks after local validation succeeds
  - Added special message for recently activated licenses
- **Files modified**: 
  - `cmd/web-licensed/main.go` - Updated `handleLicenseStatus()` function

### Scraper License Access Issue ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Data scraping failed with "no local license found" error when using isxcli.exe from web interface
- **Root Cause**: isxcli.exe was running without proper working directory, couldn't find license.dat file
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Solution**: 
  - Set working directory to project root for all command executions
  - Updated `executeCommand()`, `executeCommandWithStreaming()`, and `executeCommandWithTimeout()` functions
  - Added `cmd.Dir = getProjectPath("")` to ensure commands run from correct directory
- **Files modified**: 
  - `cmd/web-licensed/main.go` - Fixed all command execution functions

### License Detection Path Issue ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Application showing license entry page even when valid license.dat exists
- **Root Cause**: Path resolution issues when executable runs from cmd/web-licensed/ subdirectory
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed problematic `os.Chdir(exeDir)` that was breaking path resolution
  - Improved `getProjectPath()` function to handle cmd/web-licensed subdirectory
  - Added debug logging for license file detection
  - Added auto-redirect logic to license page when valid license detected
- **Files modified**: 
  - `cmd/web-licensed/main.go` - Fixed path resolution and removed directory change
  - `web/license.html` - Added auto-redirect for existing valid licenses

### Release Package Structure ✅ IMPROVED
- **Issue**: License files scattered across project, not ideal for release packaging
- **Solution**: Implemented proper release structure with executable as base
- **New Release Structure**:
  ```
  ISXApp/
  ├── web-licensed.exe           ← Main executable
  ├── license.dat                ← License file next to exe
  ├── license-config.json        ← Config next to exe
  ├── data/                      ← Data folder
  │   ├── downloads/             ← Excel files
  │   └── reports/               ← Generated reports
  ├── web/                       ← Web interface files
  │   ├── index.html
  │   ├── license.html
  │   └── static/
  └── logs/                      ← Application logs
  ```
- **Benefits**: Self-contained, portable, follows standard deployment practices
- **Files modified**: 
  - `cmd/web-licensed/main.go` - Updated `getProjectPath()` to prioritize executable directory for license files

### Project Structure Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED  
- **Goal**: Create lean, production-ready structure without redundant files
- **Removed**: 
  - Duplicate license/config files from root
  - Duplicate web and data folders from root  
  - Documentation folder (moved to git history)
  - Installer files (can be separate repo)
  - Old executables and test files
  - Non-essential markdown and config files
- **Final Clean Structure**:
  ```
  ISXDailyReportsScrapper/                  ← Development
  ├── README.md, LICENSE, go.mod           ← Essential project files
  ├── main.go, main_test.go                ← Main CLI source
  ├── internal/                            ← Core libraries
  │   ├── license/                         ← License management
  │   ├── parser/                          ← Data parsing
  │   └── updater/                         ← Auto-update system
  ├── cmd/                                 ← Command modules
  │   ├── indexcsv/, process/              ← Support commands
  │   └── web-licensed/                    ← 🎯 RELEASE PACKAGE
  │       ├── web-licensed.exe             ← Main app
  │       ├── isxcli.exe, process.exe, indexcsv.exe ← Tools
  │       ├── license.dat, license-config.json ← License files
  │       ├── data/downloads/, data/reports/ ← Data folders
  │       ├── web/                         ← Web interface
  │       └── logs/                        ← Application logs
  └── build.bat, install.sh               ← Build scripts
  ```
- **Benefits**: 50%+ file reduction, self-contained release package, clear separation

### Source Code Organization ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Goal**: Clear separation between development source and release executables  
- **Solution**: Renamed all source files with descriptive names
- **New Development Structure**:
  ```
  📁 DEVELOPMENT SOURCE:
