LICENSE INFORMATION:
===================
This software requires a valid license key to operate. License keys are available in the following durations:
- 1 Month (ISX1M-...)
- 3 Months (ISX3M-...)
- 6 Months (ISX6M-...)
- 1 Year (ISX1Y-...)

Each license is tied to a specific machine and cannot be transferred.

FIREWALL CONFIGURATION:
======================
The installer has automatically configured Windows Firewall to allow the web interface on port 8080. If you have additional security software, you may need to allow:
- Incoming connections on port 8080
- Outgoing connections for web scraping

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============
- If the web interface doesn't load, check that port 8080 is not in use by another application
- If license activation fails, verify your internet connection and license key format
- For Chrome automation issues, ensure Chrome is installed and up to date

Thank you for using ISX Daily Reports Scraper!
