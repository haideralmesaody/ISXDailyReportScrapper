# Phase 1: WebSocket Fix Implementation Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Route Registration Order (CRITICAL FIX)
**File**: `dev/internal/app/app.go`

**Before**: WebSocket was registered AFTER middleware in `setupAPIRoutes()`, causing the `http.Hijacker` error
**After**: WebSocket is registered FIRST in `setupRouter()`, before ANY middleware

```go
// Line 195-197 in app.go
// CRITICAL: Register WebSocket FIRST, before ANY middleware
// This preserves the raw http.ResponseWriter for hijacking
r.HandleFunc("/ws", a.handleWebSocket)
```

### 2. Removed Duplicate Registration
**Location**: Removed WebSocket registration from line 256 in `setupAPIRoutes()`

### 3. Enhanced WebSocket Handler (CLAUDE.md Compliance)
**Improvements**:
- Added structured logging with `slog`
- Added request ID generation and context propagation
- Added panic recovery for goroutines
- Added origin logging for security audit trail
- Added buffer size configuration

## CLAUDE.md Compliance

✅ **Idiomatic Go**: Small functions, proper error handling, panic recovery
✅ **Clear Architecture**: WebSocket isolated from HTTP middleware chain  
✅ **Everything Observable**: Structured logs with request IDs and context
✅ **No Blind Sleeps**: Uses channels and goroutines properly
✅ **Test What You Write**: Created test files for verification

## Testing

### Test Files Created:
1. `test-websocket.html` - Browser-based WebSocket test interface
2. `test-websocket.bat` - Windows batch script to run the test

### How to Test:
```bash
cd dev
go build ./cmd/web-licensed
./test-websocket.bat
```

Then check the browser for:
- ✅ "WebSocket connected successfully!" message
- ✅ No "http.Hijacker" errors in console
- ✅ Ability to send/receive messages

## Next Steps

With Phase 1 complete, the WebSocket connection should work. Next phases can proceed:
- Phase 2: Fix Frontend JavaScript errors
- Phase 3: Fix API endpoint alignment
- Phase 4: Standardize file paths

## Key Learning

The core issue was middleware wrapping the `http.ResponseWriter` before the WebSocket upgrade. Chi's middleware system modifies the ResponseWriter, breaking the `http.Hijacker` interface required for protocol upgrades. The solution is to register WebSocket routes before applying any middleware.
