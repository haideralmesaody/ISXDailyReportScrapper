# User Acceptance Test: Chi Framework Migration v0.3.0

## Executive Summary

This UAT validates the migration from gorilla/mux to Chi framework, which resolves critical HTTP response issues that were causing browser pages to hang and load incompletely. The migration should be transparent to end users while providing better performance and reliability.

## Test Objective

Verify that the Chi framework migration:
1. **Fixes HTTP response issues** - Pages load completely without hanging
2. **Maintains all functionality** - Every feature works exactly as before
3. **Improves performance** - Faster response times and better reliability
4. **Preserves user experience** - No visible changes to interface or workflow

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Windows 10/11 with latest updates
- Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser
- ISX Daily Reports Scrapper v0.3.0 with Chi framework
- Valid license.dat file in release directory
- Stable internet connection

### Test Data Setup
- Ensure `release/data/downloads/` contains sample Excel files
- Verify `release/data/reports/` has processed CSV files
- Check that `release/license.dat` is present and valid

### Environment Preparation
1. Close all running instances of the application
2. Clear browser cache and cookies for localhost:8080
3. Ensure port 8080 is available
4. Have task manager open to monitor performance

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Initial Page Loading (Critical)
**Objective**: Verify the license page loads completely without HTTP 206 issues

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to application release directory
2. Double-click `web-licensed.exe`
3. Wait for browser to open automatically to http://localhost:8080
4. **Timer Start**: Note the time when browser opens

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Browser opens within 2 seconds
- [ ] License page loads completely within 3 seconds
- [ ] TII logo displays properly
- [ ] License status shows (either "Valid" or "Activation Required")
- [ ] No browser loading spinner remains active
- [ ] **Timer End**: Complete page load in < 5 seconds total

**Critical Success Criteria**:
- ❌ **FAIL if**: Page keeps loading indefinitely (old HTTP 206 bug)
- ❌ **FAIL if**: Only partial content displays
- ❌ **FAIL if**: Browser shows "waiting for localhost" message
- ✅ **PASS if**: Complete page loads with all elements visible

### Scenario 2: License Validation Flow
**Objective**: Ensure license checking and navigation works properly

**Steps**:
1. From loaded license page, observe license status
2. If license is valid, click "Continue to Application" or wait for auto-redirect
3. If license needs activation, enter a test license key (if available)

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] License status displays clearly ("Valid" or "Activation Required")
- [ ] Days remaining shown if license is valid
- [ ] Auto-redirect to main app occurs within 3 seconds for valid license
- [ ] License activation form works if needed
- [ ] Navigation to `/app` occurs smoothly

**Performance Criteria**:
- License check API call (`/api/license/status`) completes < 500ms
- No duplicate requests made
- WebSocket connection establishes successfully

### Scenario 3: Main Application Interface
**Objective**: Verify main app loads with all components

**Steps**:
1. Access main application page (http://localhost:8080/app)
2. Wait for all components to load
3. Check each section: Files, Scraper, Processor, Index CSV, etc.
4. Verify data loads in all tables and charts

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Main application page loads completely
- [ ] All navigation tabs/sections are visible
- [ ] Data tables populate with existing data
- [ ] Charts render properly (if data exists)
- [ ] WebSocket connection status shows "Connected"
- [ ] No console errors in browser developer tools

**Load Time Criteria**:
- Initial page load: < 2 seconds
- Data loading: < 3 seconds
- Total ready state: < 5 seconds

### Scenario 4: Real-time Updates (WebSocket)
**Objective**: Confirm WebSocket communication works without middleware interference

**Steps**:
1. Open browser developer tools → Network tab
2. From main app, initiate any pipeline operation (if available)
3. Monitor WebSocket messages in Network tab
4. Observe real-time updates in the interface

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] WebSocket connection establishes on page load
- [ ] WebSocket upgrade succeeds (Status 101)
- [ ] Real-time messages received and displayed
- [ ] No connection drops or reconnection attempts
- [ ] Pipeline progress updates appear immediately

**WebSocket Health Criteria**:
- Connection time: < 1 second
- Message latency: < 100ms
- Zero failed connection attempts

### Scenario 5: API Endpoints Functionality
**Objective**: Verify all API endpoints respond correctly

**Steps**:
1. Open browser developer tools → Network tab
2. Navigate through different sections of the app
3. Monitor API calls in Network tab
4. Test each major endpoint group

**API Endpoints to Test**:
- [ ] `GET /api/license/status` - Returns JSON with license info
- [ ] `GET /api/data/reports` - Returns list of available reports
- [ ] `GET /api/data/tickers` - Returns ticker data
- [ ] `GET /api/data/indices` - Returns index data
- [ ] `GET /api/pipeline/status` - Returns pipeline status

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] All API calls return HTTP 200 status
- [ ] Response Content-Type is `application/json`
- [ ] Response data is valid JSON format
- [ ] No HTTP 206 (Partial Content) responses
- [ ] Response times < 500ms for all endpoints

### Scenario 6: Static Asset Loading
**Objective**: Ensure CSS, JS, and images load properly

**Steps**:
1. Open browser developer tools → Network tab
2. Hard refresh the license page (Ctrl+F5)
3. Navigate to main app
4. Check all static assets in Network tab

**Static Assets to Verify**:
- [ ] `/static/css/main.css` - Loads successfully
- [ ] `/static/js/main.js` - Loads and executes
- [ ] `/static/images/TII Logo.jpg` - Displays correctly
- [ ] `/static/images/favicon.svg` - Shows in browser tab
- [ ] Any additional CSS/JS files

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] All static assets return HTTP 200
- [ ] Proper Content-Type headers set
- [ ] Images display correctly
- [ ] Stylesheets apply properly
- [ ] JavaScript executes without errors

### Scenario 7: Error Handling
**Objective**: Test error conditions and recovery

**Steps**:
1. Disconnect internet connection temporarily
2. Try accessing the application
3. Reconnect internet
4. Test invalid API requests (optional)

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Application shows appropriate error messages
- [ ] Graceful handling of network issues
- [ ] Automatic recovery when connection resumes
- [ ] No crashes or infinite loading states
