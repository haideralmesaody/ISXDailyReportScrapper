### 1. Button and Form Elements
**Incorrect**: "Download Fresh Data" button  
**Correct**: "Start Scraping" button within the ISX Data Collection form

### 2. Form Fields
**Added**: Proper form field descriptions:
- Mode dropdown: "Initial (Fresh start)" or "Accumulative (Incremental)"
- Headless Browser dropdown: "Yes (Headless)" or "No (Visible)"

- "ISX Data Download Progress" header
- Animated progress bar with percentage
- Separate "Downloaded" and "Existing" counters

- Status text at bottom

### 4. Pipeline Visualization
**Clarified**: Four stages displayed horizontally:
