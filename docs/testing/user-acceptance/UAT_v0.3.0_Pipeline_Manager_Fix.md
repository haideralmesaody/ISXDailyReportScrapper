# User Acceptance Test: Pipeline Manager Fix

**Version**: v0.3.0-alpha  
**Feature**: Automatic Pipeline Progression  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Document Type**: User Acceptance Test (UAT)

## Executive Summary

In previous versions (v0.2.0), users reported that after clicking "Update Data" and successfully downloading files from the ISX website, the pipeline would stop and not continue to process the data. This meant users had to manually run additional steps to complete their data update.

Version v0.3.0 fixes this issue with a new Pipeline Manager that ensures all data processing stages run automatically in sequence. This UAT validates that the complete pipeline now works as users expect - click once, get all your data.

## What's New in v0.3.0

### The Fix
- **Automatic Pipeline Progression**: All stages now run automatically
- **Better Progress Tracking**: See real-time progress for each stage
- **Improved Error Messages**: Clearer information when something goes wrong

### What Hasn't Changed
- Same user interface
- Same data formats
- Same file locations
- Same final results

## Prerequisites

Before starting these tests, ensure you have:

- [ ] ISX Daily Reports Scrapper v0.3.0 installed
- [ ] Valid license file (license.dat)
- [ ] Internet connection for ISX website access
- [ ] At least 2GB free disk space
- [ ] 15-20 minutes for testing

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Pipeline Execution ðŸ”´ CRITICAL

**Purpose**: Verify the main bug is fixed - pipeline completes all stages automatically

**Steps**:

1. **Start the Application**
   - Open command prompt
   - Navigate to release folder
   - Run: `web-licensed.exe`
   - Open browser to http://localhost:8080

2. **Clear Previous Data** (Optional)
   - Delete files from `data/downloads/` folder
   - Delete files from `data/reports/` folder

3. **Start Pipeline**
   - Click "Update Data" button
   - Enter date range:
     - From: 2025-01-01
     - To: 2025-01-10
   - Leave mode as "Initial"
   - Click "Start Update"

4. **Monitor Progress**
   - Watch the pipeline stages panel
   - You should see each stage activate in order:
     1. **Scraping** - "Downloading reports from ISX..."
     2. **Processing** - "Converting Excel files to CSV..."
     3. **Indices** - "Extracting market indices..."
     4. **Analysis** - "Generating ticker summaries..."

5. **Verify Completion**
   - All 4 stages should show green checkmarks
   - Final message: "Pipeline completed successfully"
   - No manual intervention required

**Expected Results**:
- âœ… All stages complete automatically (THIS IS THE KEY FIX!)
- âœ… Progress bars fill up for each stage
- âœ… Clear status messages throughout
- âœ… Data appears in charts and ticker list

**Success Criteria**: 
Pipeline MUST complete all 4 stages without stopping after scraping.

### Scenario 2: Large Date Range Processing

**Purpose**: Test pipeline with significant data volume

**Steps**:

1. **Start Fresh Pipeline**
   - Click "Update Data"
   - Enter larger date range:
     - From: 2024-01-01
     - To: 2024-12-31
   - Click "Start Update"

2. **Monitor Performance**
   - Note the ETA shown for each stage
   - Progress should update smoothly
   - No freezing or hanging

3. **During Processing**
   - You can continue using other features
   - Charts remain responsive
   - WebSocket connection stays active

**Expected Results**:
- âœ… Pipeline handles large dataset
- âœ… ETA calculations appear reasonable
- âœ… Progress updates regularly
- âœ… All stages complete successfully

**Time Estimate**: 20-30 minutes for full year

### Scenario 3: Error Handling

**Purpose**: Verify clear error messages when issues occur

**Test 3.1: Network Interruption**

1. Start pipeline with normal date range
2. After scraping starts, disconnect internet
3. Observe error handling

**Expected**:
- Clear error message about network issue
- Scraping stage shows as failed
- Other stages remain pending
- No application crash

**Test 3.2: Invalid Date Range**

1. Click "Update Data"
2. Enter invalid dates:
   - From: 2026-01-01 (future date)
   - To: 2026-12-31
3. Click "Start Update"

**Expected**:
- Immediate validation error
- Clear message about invalid dates
- Pipeline doesn't start

### Scenario 4: Progress Tracking Features

**Purpose**: Validate enhanced progress information

**Steps**:

1. Start a normal pipeline run
2. Observe progress information for each stage

**What to Look For**:

**During Scraping**:
- Current file being downloaded
- X of Y files completed
- Download progress percentage
- ETA for completion

**During Processing**:
- Current Excel file being processed
- Files completed counter
- Processing speed indicator

**During Indices**:
- "Extracting ISX60 data..."
- "Extracting ISX15 data..."
- Quick completion (usually < 1 minute)

**During Analysis**:
- Number of tickers being analyzed
- Progress through ticker list
- Final summary generation

**Expected**: Clear, informative progress messages throughout

### Scenario 5: Concurrent Usage

**Purpose**: Test system stability with multiple browser tabs

**Steps**:

1. Open 3 browser tabs to http://localhost:8080
2. Start pipeline in first tab
3. Observe other tabs

**Expected Results**:
- âœ… All tabs show same progress
- âœ… Updates appear simultaneously
- âœ… Any tab can view results
- âœ… No interference between tabs

### Scenario 6: Resume After Browser Close

**Purpose**: Test pipeline continues even if browser closed

**Steps**:

1. Start pipeline
2. After scraping begins, close browser
3. Wait 2 minutes
4. Reopen browser to http://localhost:8080

**Expected Results**:
- âœ… Pipeline continued running
- âœ… Current progress displayed
- âœ… Can see what stages completed
- âœ… Results available when done
