### Total: 121 tasks (~620 hours)

### Current Sprint Focus - UPDATED 2025-01-21
1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: PIPE-001 to PIPE-008 (Core pipeline refactoring - ALL DONE!)
2. **CRITICAL PRIORITY**: UI-006 to UI-010 (Frontend Modularization - Foundation for all future UI work)
3. **HIGH PRIORITY**: COMM-009 (Complete pipeline testing - validate test suite)
4. **NEW PRIORITY**: BUG-001, BUG-002, BUG-006 (Core bug reporting system)
5. **NEXT PRIORITY**: COMM-005 to COMM-008 (Frontend progress display enhancements)
6. **INFRASTRUCTURE**: INFRA-001 to INFRA-004 (Docker and PostgreSQL foundation)

### Workflow Improvement Recommendations (Added 2025-07-21)

#### **A. Enhanced Sprint Management**
- **Limit Active Epics**: Maximum 2-3 epics per sprint to improve focus
- **Epic Completion Priority**: Complete entire epics before starting new ones
- **Current Recommendation**: Complete COMM epic entirely before starting INFRA tasks

#### **B. Time Tracking Enhancements** 
- **Mandatory Actual Time Reporting**: All completed tasks must include actual hours spent
- **Estimation Improvement**: Use actual time data to improve future estimates
- **Velocity Tracking**: Calculate team velocity based on completed epic hours

#### **C. Dependency Management**
- **Dependency Validation**: Implement checks to prevent work on blocked tasks
- **Clear Dependency Chains**: Document transitive dependencies between tasks
- **Dependency Visualization**: Consider adding dependency graphs to task documentation

#### **D. Epic Completion Process**
- **Completion Checklist**: Define criteria for epic completion (all tasks DONE, documentation updated, testing complete)
- **Milestone Documentation**: Document lessons learned and metrics for completed epics
- **Team Celebrations**: Acknowledge epic completions to maintain morale and momentum

#### **E. Task State Management**
- **Single Developer Constraint**: Only one task per developer should be IN_PROGRESS at a time
- **Regular State Updates**: Update task status immediately when state changes occur
- **Blocked Task Tracking**: Clearly document blocking reasons and resolution paths

### Quick Actions
1. Move tasks from BACKLOG to READY when prioritized
2. Assign developer and move to IN_PROGRESS
3. Move to IN_REVIEW when code is complete
4. Move to DONE after testing and deployment
5. Update estimates based on actual time spent
